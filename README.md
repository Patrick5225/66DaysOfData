# What is 66DaysOfData?
#66DaysOfData is an intiative created by [Ken Jee](https://github.com/PlayingNumbers) to help develop studying habits for data science/analytics. As part of the challenge, there are 2 requirements for #66DaysOfData:

1) You must spend at least 5 minutes learning data science/analytics for each of the 66 days. This must be done for 66 days straight without skipping on a day.
2) You must share what you are working on with the #66DaysOfData hashtag on any platform you are comfortable with. I used Discord to share my progress.

The goal of the challenge is to help create a habit of consistent daily learning. The requirements are very small and only asks you to spend 5 minutes of your time each day to learn something new. Sharing what you are working on everyday will help hold you accountable and work with other like-minded people.
